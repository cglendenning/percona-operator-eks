    unit: marks tests as unit tests (fast, no cluster dependency, may use mocks)
    integration: marks tests as integration tests (verify dependencies like K8s version, Helm repo, StorageClass)
    resiliency: marks tests as resiliency tests (verify recovery after chaos events)
    dr: marks tests as disaster recovery scenario tests (data-driven from disaster_scenarios.json)
    slow: marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m "not slow"')
    cluster: marks tests that require cluster access
    helm: marks tests that require Helm
    backup: marks tests related to backups
